# Next.js 15 Data Fetching Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications involving data fetching: inadequate error handling during the fetching process.  The `about.js` page attempts to fetch data from an API endpoint. However, the API endpoint simulates intermittent failures. This lack of robust error handling can lead to runtime crashes in the browser if the API request fails. The solution demonstrates how to properly handle potential errors, preventing application crashes and providing users with a better experience.

## Bug

The `about.js` file attempts to fetch data without properly handling cases where the API request might fail.  The `fetchData` function makes the API call, but doesn't gracefully handle potential errors. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes if the API returns an error.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation.  It uses a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during the API request. If an error occurs, it gracefully displays an error message to the user instead of crashing the application.  It also includes better error handling and feedback mechanisms.
